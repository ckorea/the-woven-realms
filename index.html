            <div class="content">
                <p>In this world, three distinct realms - the <a href="#sky-islands">Sky Islands</a> (inspired by Korea), the <a href="#jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> (inspired by China), and the <a href="#frost-reaches">Frost Reaches</a> (inspired by Slavic cultures) - are physically connected by an ever-shifting network of magical threads called <a href="#the-loom">the Loom</a>. These threads serve as pathways between the realms, allowing for travel, trade, and the exchange of <a href="#magic-systems">magic</a> and culture.</p>
