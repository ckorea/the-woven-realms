The Woven Realms

Core Concept
In this world, three distinct realms - the Sky Islands (inspired by Korea), the Jade Empire (inspired by China), and the Frost Reaches (inspired by Slavic cultures) - are physically connected by an ever-shifting network of magical threads called the Loom. These threads serve as pathways between the realms, allowing for travel, trade, and the exchange of magic and culture.

World Structure

The Sky Islands: Floating landmasses high in the clouds, home to wind spirits and sky sailors.
The Jade Empire: A vast terrestrial realm of diverse landscapes, from misty mountains to bamboo forests.
The Frost Reaches: An icy domain where the veil between the physical and spirit worlds is thin.
The Loom: The magical network of threads connecting all realms, constantly shifting and changing.

Magic Systems

Song Magic (Sky Islands): Harnesses the power of music and voice to control winds and influence spirits.
Craft Magic (Jade Empire): Focuses on infusing objects with magical properties and manipulating the natural world.
Hearth Magic (Frost Reaches): Centers on home, family, and community, with rituals tied to daily life and the seasons.

Key Locations

The Floating Citadel: The grand capital of the Sky Islands, a marvel of wind-borne architecture.
The Eternal Palace: Heart of the Jade Empire, where the Dragon Empress resides and governs.
The Fireside Hall: A massive, ever-warm gathering place for the clans of the Frost Reaches.
The Nexus Market: A bustling bazaar that appears at different Loom intersections, bringing all cultures together.

Major Factions

The Thread Weavers: A guild of mages who maintain and navigate the Loom, keeping the realms connected.
The Harmony Seekers: Diplomats and scholars working to promote peace and cultural exchange among the realms.
The Unravelers: A secretive group seeking to sever the connections between realms, believing separation is the natural order.
